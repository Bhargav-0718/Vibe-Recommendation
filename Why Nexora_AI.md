## 💡 Why AI at Nexora?

I’m genuinely excited about this opportunity because Nexora’s approach to using AI for vibe-driven fashion recommendations aligns perfectly with my interests in machine learning and generative AI. Through projects like my **NLP Contract Summarization & Tier-wise Clause Review** system and **Reinforcement Learning Agent (PPO-based)**, I’ve gained hands-on experience with models such as GPT, Legal-BERT, and PPO, as well as frameworks like **LangChain** and **Hugging Face**.  

What excites me about Nexora is the chance to apply these skills in a real-world, user-facing product — where **embeddings, vector search, and GenAI** come together to understand human moods and styles. I see this internship as an opportunity to learn how large-scale recommendation systems are built, optimized, and deployed, while contributing to something that blends **creativity, personalization, and AI** in a meaningful way.
